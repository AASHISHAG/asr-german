# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) - German
This is my [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5623384702976000) Project with the [Distributed Little Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/).

The aim of this project is to develop a working Speech to Text module for the Red Hen Labâ€™s current Audio processing pipeline. The initial goal is to extend current Deep Speech model(audio only) to Red Hen lab's TV news videos datasets.
