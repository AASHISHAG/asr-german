# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) - German
_This is my [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5623384702976000) Project with the [Distributed Little Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/)._

The aim of this project is to develop a working Speech to Text module for the Red Hen Labâ€™s current Audio processing pipeline. The initial goal is to extend current Deep Speech model to open-source datasets and later training the model on a larger German-Today dataset. Finally, the project aims to put the model into production to process massive Red Hen Lab's TV news videos datasets.
